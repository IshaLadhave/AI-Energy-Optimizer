# AI-Energy-Optimizer
This project, AI-Driven Smart Energy Optimizer, is a Python-based desktop application that leverages machine learning and real-time weather data to provide personalized energy consumption recommendations. Using historical energy data, a Linear Regression model predicts energy usage based on temperature, time of day, and day of the week. The application fetches real-time temperature from the OpenWeatherMap API and offers insights to help users optimize their energy usage. The user-friendly interface, built with Tkinter, allows users to input specific conditions and receive predictions, as well as actionable recommendations for improving energy efficiency.
